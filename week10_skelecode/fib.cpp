/*INSTRUCTIONS:
 * The goal of this program is to calculate the fibonacci sequence of given number 'n'. The fibonacci sequence is 
 * defined by the following equation: Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2, or in other words, (n-1)+(n-2). Your task is to write a program that
 * calculates the fibonacci number recursively
 * 
 *  - Calculate the fibonacci number of given number 'n' recursively
 *  - Only take positive numbers and output a statement stating that negative numbers are not allowed
 *  - Return the correct result 
 *
