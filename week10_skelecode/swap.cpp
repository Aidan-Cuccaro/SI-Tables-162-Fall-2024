/*INSTRUCTIONS:
 * The goal of this program is to take a string and swap all of the letters in it. In other words, if a user inputted 'hello'
 * your program should return 'olleh'. This program should work with strings of multiple words as well (as in, swapping the entire string, not just the individual words).
 * Your program should achieve the following:
 * 
 *  - Swap a string recursively
 *  - Return the correct result
 * 
 * EXTRA: feeling good about this? Add another function that checks if the string is a palindrome!
 *
