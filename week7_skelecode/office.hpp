/* INSTRUCTIONS:
 * This header file defines a class called Office, which inherits from a base class Building.
 * 
 * To implement this class, follow these steps:
 * 
 * 1. **Define Member Variables**: 
 *    - `employees`: An integer to store the number of employees working in the office.
 *    - `has_conference_room`: A boolean to indicate whether the office has a conference room.
 * 
 * 2. **Constructor**: Implement the constructor that initializes the base class (Building) with the name and number of floors, 
 *    and initializes the member variables `employees` and `has_conference_room`. 
 *    This can be done using an initializer list.
 *
 * 3. **Member Functions**:
 *    - Implement the `print_info()` function, which should output relevant information about the office, 
 *      such as its name, number of floors, number of employees, and whether it has a conference room.
 *    - (EXTRA) Implement the `get_type()` function, which should return a string indicating the type of building (e.g., "Office").
 * 
 * 4. **Usage**: After implementing the class, you should be able to create instances of Office and call the print_info() 
 *    and get_type() methods to see the output.
 * 
 * Example Implementation:
 * 
 * Building Name: Tech Hub
 * Number of Floors: 5
 * Number of Employees: 200
 * Has Conference Room: Yes
 * Type: Office 
 * 
 * Reminder that 'Type: Office' is Extra and does not have to be implemented.
