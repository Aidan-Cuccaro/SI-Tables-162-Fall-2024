/* INSTRUCTIONS:
 * This header file defines a class called Library, which inherits from a base class Building.
 * 
 * To implement this class, follow these steps:
 * 
 * 1. **Define Member Variables**: 
 *    - `books`: An integer to store the number of books available in the library.
 *    - `has_study_rooms`: A boolean to indicate whether the library has study rooms.
 * 
 * 2. **Constructor**: Implement the constructor that initializes the base class (Building) with the name and number of floors, 
 *    and initializes the member variables `books` and `has_study_rooms`. 
 *    This can be done using an initializer list.
 *
 * 3. **Member Functions**:
 *    - Implement the `print_info()` function, which should output relevant information about the library, 
 *      such as its name, number of floors, number of books, and whether it has study rooms.
 *    - (EXTRA) Implement the `get_type()` function, which should return a string indicating the type of building (e.g., "Library").
 * 
 * 4. **Usage**: After implementing the class, you should be able to create instances of Library and call the print_info() 
 *    and get_type() methods to see the output.
 * 
 * Example Implementation:
 * 
 * Building Name: Central Library
 * Number of Floors: 3
 * Number of Books: 15000
 * Has Study Rooms: Yes
 * Type: Library 
 * 
 * Reminder that 'Type: Library' is Extra and does not have to be implemented.
