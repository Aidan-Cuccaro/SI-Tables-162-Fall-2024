/* INSTRUCTIONS:
 * This header file defines a class called House, which inherits from a base class Building.
 * 
 * To implement this class, follow these steps:
 * 
 * 1. **Define Member Variables**: 
 *    - `bedrooms`: An integer to store the number of bedrooms in the house.
 *    - `has_garden`: A boolean to indicate whether the house has a garden.
 * 
 * 3. **Constructor**: Implement the constructor that initializes the base class (Building) with the name and number of floors, 
 *    and initializes the member variables `bedrooms` and `has_garden`. 
 *    This can be done using an initializer list.
 *
 * 4. **Member Functions**:
 *    - Implement the `print_info()` function, which should output relevant information about the house, 
 *      such as its name, number of floors, number of bedrooms, and whether it has a garden.
 *    - (EXTRA) Implement the `get_type()` function, which should return a string indicating the type of building (e.g., "House").
 * 
 * 5. **Usage**: After implementing the class, you should be able to create instances of House and call the print_info() 
 *    and get_type() methods to see the output.
 * 
 * Example Implementation:
 * 
 * Building Name: Sunny Villa
 * Number of Floors: 2
 * Number of Bedrooms: 3
 * Has Garden: Yes
 * Type: House 
 * 
 * Reminder that 'Type: House' is Extra and does not have to be implemented.
